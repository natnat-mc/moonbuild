    summary: Small build system in between make and a build.sh
    detailed: >
        moonbuild is a small build system that simplifies your
        build definitions by allowing you to use declarative as
        well as imperative rules.
        It represents the build as a DAG with explicit ordering,
        and doesn't give you any default confusing rules (unlike
        make)
